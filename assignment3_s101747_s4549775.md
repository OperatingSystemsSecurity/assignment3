Our Makefile uses your default C compiler, so if you cannot compile the quines, you may have to use `gcc` explicitly (`CC=gcc make`). We successfully tested both included quines with GCC 7.2.0.

We started with this quine by Dario Dariol:

```
main(a){printf(a="main(a){printf(a=%c%s%c,34,a,34);}",34,a,34);}
```

The idea is pretty simple. The main function solely consists of a print statement, that prints a string `a` which is the program's code itself, except for the string `a`.

In place of the string `a` we have format string `%c%s%c`, which expects a `char`, a string (= pointer to a `char`), and another `char`. The two characters are used to print `"`, because we cannot put real quotes there, as they have a special meaning in C. `char`s are just bytes in C, and 34 is the byte corresponding to the character `"`. The string is then given a reference to `a`, so now the string contains the whole code of the C program, which is then printed.

Normally we would have to import `stdio.h` to provide the `printf` function, and `gcc` complains about this, but it compiles it anyway. If you do not declare the type of a function explicitly in C, then it defaults to type `int`, so we can just write `main(…) { … }`.

Now that we understand the program, let's run it.

```
make quine1
./quine1
```

We get a segmentation fault. Why is that?

The type of `a` is not explicitly defined, but it is listed as a parameter of the main function, which should not be necessary. I expect that this quine made use of an implicit type given to `a` when used as a parameter to the main function, but this behavior does not seem to hold anymore.

We made the type of `a` explicit like this:

```
main(char *a){printf(a="main(char *a){printf(a=%c%s%c,34,a,34);}",34,a,34);}
```

Now the program works. Based on this we also made a second quine completely on our own, using the same principle:

```
main(){char *c="main(){char *c=%c%s%c;printf(c,34,c,34);}";printf(c,34,c,34);}
```
