Our Makefile uses your default C compiler, so if you cannot compile the quines, you may have to use `gcc` explicitly (`CC=gcc make`). We successfully tested both included quines with GCC 7.2.0.

We started with this quine by Dario Dariol:

```
main(a){printf(a="main(a){printf(a=%c%s%c,34,a,34);}",34,a,34);}
```

The idea is pretty simple. The main function solely consists of a print statement, that prints a string `a` which is the program's code itself, except for the string `a`.

In place of the string `a` we have format string `%c%s%c`, which expects a `char`, a string (= pointer to a `char`), and another `char`. The two characters are used to print `"`, because we cannot put real quotes there, as they have a special meaning in C. `char`s are just bytes in C, and 34 is the byte corresponding to the character `"`. The string is then given a reference to `a`, so now the string contains the whole code of the C program, which is then printed.

Normally we would have to import `stdio.h` to provide the `printf` function, and `gcc` complains about this, but it compiles it anyway. If you do not declare the type of a function explicitly in C, then it defaults to type `int`, so we can just write `main(…) { … }`.

Now that we understand the program, let's run it.

```
make quine1
./quine1
```

We get a segmentation fault. Why is that?

The type of `a` is not explicitly defined, but it is listed as a parameter of the main function, which should not be necessary. I expect that this quine made use of an implicit type given to `a` when used as a parameter to the main function, but this behavior does not seem to hold anymore.

We made the type of `a` explicit like this:

```
main(char *a){printf(a="main(char *a){printf(a=%c%s%c,34,a,34);}",34,a,34);}
```

Now the program works. Based on this we also made a second quine completely on our own, using the same principle:

```
main(){char *c="main(){char *c=%c%s%c;printf(c,34,c,34);}";printf(c,34,c,34);}
```

## a
We decided to use the file permission of some file as our covert channel. The file permissions range from octal 000 to octal 777, which are 9 bits we can modify.

To demonstrate the concept we made a covert sender script in Python, that generates random 9 bit long numbers, encodes them as file permission on the file `./channel`, then sleeps a second, and starts again. Of course you could also send something more useful, like bits of a file, or any other binary data broken into chunks of 9 bits.

We also made a Python covert receiver that reads the file permissions from the `./channel` file and prints the decimal number they encode. However since there is no easy way to listen for file changes in Python without relying on third party libraries, we had to use polling. This approach is not very reliable, as there could be timing problems. Additionally you need to check when the file changed on every poll, because you need to know whether the file's attributes were updated since it was checked the last time. Also the latency when processing the input may be as high as the polling rate.

In C you can make use of the inotify API to wait until the file attributes are changed, so we also implemented a blocking, event based covert receiver in C. Using the event based API solved all of the problems with the polling receiver.

To run the covert channel demo, first compile the C covert receiver, and create the `channel` file with `make`. Then in one shell start the receiver `./covert_receiver`, and in a second shell start the sender `./covert_sender.py`. You should see that the receiver receives the same numbers that the sender sends.
